# Analyze A/B Test Results
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

<b>Overview</b>

A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.
